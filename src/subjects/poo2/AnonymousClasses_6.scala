/**
  * Created by Pedro.
 *  With anonymous classes, class definitions donâ€™t need to be stable or reusable.
 *  When a subclass will only be needed once, the anonymous class syntax can help to simplify your code base.
 *
 *  To define a one-time anonymous class, instantiate the parent (and potentially abstract) class and follow
 *  the class name and parameters with curly braces containing your implementation.
 *  The result is an instance that does extend the given parent class with a one-time implementation,
 *  but can be used like an instance from a traditional class definition.
